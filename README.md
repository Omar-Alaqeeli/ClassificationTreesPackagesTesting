## Classification Trees R Packages Testing

The R scripts in this page are for testing five Classification Trees R packages; rpart, ctree, evtree, tree and C5.0, using 22 single-cell RNA-seq datasets from [conquer](http://imlspenticton.uzh.ch:3838/conquer/) (consistent quantification of external rna-seq data). 

In order to proceed with testing, you must download the corresponding datasets (each script has name the same name as its dataset) as save it in a folder name `datasets`.
